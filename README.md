## The Problem

Ever opened your fridge and thought, *“What can I make with this?”*  
This app solves that problem by helping users **instantly discover dishes** based on the ingredients they already have at home.

Built using **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this recipe recommendation tool uses a cleaned dataset of 20,000+ recipes and a dynamic keyword-matching engine.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔍 **Ingredient-Based Search** – Enter a few ingredients and get dish suggestions instantly
- 🧠 **Smart Matching** – Python scripts extract & standardize keywords from ingredient lists
- 🔢 **Recipe Sorting** – Results are ranked by **rating**, **relevance**, and **prep time**
- 📊 **20,000+ Recipes** – Cleaned and transformed dataset with structured formatting
- 🌐 **Live Hosted** – Deployed publicly on PythonAnywhere (see live demo above)

## 🧑‍💻 What I Did (Behind the Scenes)

- **Cleaned and transformed** a raw dataset of 20,000+ recipes by removing irrelevant columns and formatting inconsistencies.
- Wrote **custom Python scripts** to **extract keywords** from ingredient text and map them accurately for matching.
- Designed a **Flask-based web app** to accept user input, filter recipes, and serve ranked suggestions.
- Applied **sorting logic** by `rating`, `time`, and `relevance` to prioritize best results for the user.
- Optimized the UX with **custom CSS styling**, responsive layout, and real-time input handling.
